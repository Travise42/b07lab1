Lab #1 consists of a Polynomials class that
- stores its coefficients,
- can add itself to another polynomial,
- can evaluate its value at some x value,
- and can check whether it has a root at a certain x value

Lab #2 consists of modifications to the Polynomials class:
- replace array of coefficents with two arrays representing coefficients and their respective exponents
  (this allows for polynomials of high degrees without the use of a large amount of space)
- update methods from Lab #1 to use the modified arrays
- create a mutliply method that multiplies polynomials and returns the result
- add a constructor that creates a polynomial object from a file
- add a method to save the poynomial to a file
